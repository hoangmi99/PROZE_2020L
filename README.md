### LUNAR LANDER

Lunar Lander is a game created in Java using a graphical user interface (GUI).  
You can find an instruction (in Polish) how to run the game in file "instrukcja uzytkownika.pdf".  
Besides the instruction there is also a network protocol, as the game is using a client-server model, which allows you to play "online" and "offline".
